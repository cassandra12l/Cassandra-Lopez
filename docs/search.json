    "text": "Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) Bilingüe Suite\nGiven the increasing Latine Spanish-speaking population, and the gap in the availability of multilingual SLPs and AuDs service providers in the US, the CSD Bilingüe Suite serves as an innovative initiative designed to foster a dynamic space for professional development in the fields of speech, language, and hearing sciences in order to close this gap. The task force focuses on developing plain language skills in Spanish and English while practicing cultural humility to enrich students’ learning and readiness in serving and engaging with culturally and linguistically diverse communities, specifically, the Latine population.\nLong-term Objectives:\n\nEquip undergraduate and graduate students with the essential skills needed to become bilingual SLPs or AuDs, while empowering them to advocate for the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse communities\nRaise awareness of the CSD field among underrepresented undergraduate students to encourage enrollment in the Communication Sciences and Disorders (COSI) major at CWRU, while providing resources to support their success throughout the program\nCreate bilingual resources to explain the CSD field, SLP and AuD professions, and communication disorders, targeting students, clinicians, and Spanish-speaking parents/caregivers in order to improve understanding and provide culturally relevant support\n\nCase Western Reserve University: Innovation Week 2024 - Poster Pitch\n\nAmerican Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA): 2023 Convention - Virtual Poster\n\nMaster’s Thesis\nLopez, C.

    "text": "My interest in research was ignited during my undergraduate career at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), where I had the opportunity of working as a research assistant in Dr. Lauren Calandruccio’s Speech and Auditory Research Lab. In this role, I became deeply fascinated by the transformative power of research in the development of assessments, evidence-based practices, and instruments to address varying communication disorders. As a native Spanish speaker and Latine individual, I have a unique awareness on how cultural and linguistic factors can impact Latine families’ access to education, resources, and interventions for communication disorders. This personal perspective has fueled my commitment to advancing the limited research on bilingual populations and individuals who speak a language other than English. After graduating CWRU, I pursued my master’s degree in Speech-Language Pathology with a Bilingual Track at Indiana University, Bloomington. While working closely with Spanish-English bilingual families, I observed the critical shortage of bilingual prevention, assessments, treatment tools, and multilingual speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and Audiologists (AuDs). This gap creates significant barriers to receiving and delivering culturally and linguistically responsive services, further underlining the need for increased bilingual resources and clinicians."
